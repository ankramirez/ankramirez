- 👋 Hi, I’m @ankramirez
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Science and Machine Learning, specially in the health sector.
- 🌱 I’m currently brushing my abilities with databases, Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
- 💞️ I enjoy working with data and making sense out of it, therefore I'd be willing and probaly would enjoy working with practically any dataset!
- I had the oportunity to work in the health sector, more specifically in Radiotherapy, for more than 4 years where I was able to see an update on Radiotherapy technology (EBRT and BT) worth of 30 years. Now I've have the ambition to help in the latest updates in this field.
