- 👋 Hi, I’m @ankramirez
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Science and Machine Learning, specially in the health sector.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, R, and other tools for Data Science.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Clinical Trials, but not exclusively, I enjoy working with data and making sense out of it, therefore I'd be willing and probaly enjoyed working with practically any dataset.
