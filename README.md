- 👋 Hi, I’m @ankramirez
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Science, Machine Learning and MLOps.
- 🌱 I’m currently brushing my abilities with Data Engineering and MLOps.
- 💞️ I enjoy working with data and making sense out of it, I'd enjoy working with practically any dataset!

I had the oportunity to work in the health sector, more specifically in Radiotherapy, for more than 4 years where I was witness and part of a 30 years update in health caring! 
For the last 2 yearst I've been working as a Data Scientist and I just can't get enough of it!
